# geowarp

This is the R package for the GeoWarp method, described in the paper ``GeoWarp: Warped spatial processes for inferring subsea sediment properties'' (link forthcoming).

There is a separate repository that uses this package for the results of the GeoWarp paper at https://github.com/mbertolacci/geowarp-workflow/.

## Installation

The package is available on GitHub, and can be installed using the following command:

```R
devtools::install_github('mbertolacci/geowarp')
```

## Examples

There are two example scripts in the [`inst/examples` folder](https://github.com/mbertolacci/geowarp/tree/main/inst/examples), along with a README.md file that describes how to run them.
